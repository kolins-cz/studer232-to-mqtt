4. Application layer

The OSI layers 3 to 6 are not used. The application layer defines a number of « services ».
A DTE sends a request frame and waits for a response frame from the Xcom-232i. If an
error in the header checksum or data checksum is detected, there is no response from the
application layer and the Xcom-232i waits for another request as if nothing has been
received.

The Xcom-232i copies the src_addr of the request in the response dst_addr.

4.1 Services

The first two bytes of frame_data define the type of service and different flags for this
service.

service_flags service_id service_data

1 byte 1 byte N bytes

service flags:
BIT7-BIT4_ : reserved.

BIT1 : is_response flag, 0 if it is a request from the DTE to the Xcom-232i, 1
if it is response from the Xcom-232i.

BITO : error flag, 0 in case of success, 1 if an error occurred. In case of a
request, error is always 0.

service_id:

One of the following services, described later in this document:

READ_PROPERTY = 0x01

service data:

The data specific to the service. In case of a problem the errors are reported in a service-
specific way, but the response has to include the error code described in the next section.

4.2 Object model

The different data accessible on each device are organized in object classes. Every object
class has a number of properties. The service READ_PROPERTY is used to read the object’s
properties.
