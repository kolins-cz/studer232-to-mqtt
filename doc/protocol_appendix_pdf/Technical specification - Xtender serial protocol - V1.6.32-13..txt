4.2.2 WRITE_PROPERTY service
This service is used to write an object’s property.

The DTE sends a request frame with the following frame_data:

service_flags service_id object_type object_id property_id property_data
1 byte 1 byte 2 bytes 4 bytes 2 bytes n byte
0x00 0x02
service_flags : is_response = 0, error = 0
service_id : 0x02 for WRITE_PROPERTY
object_type : the object type identifier, defined later in this document
object_id : the object identifier, specific to each object type, i.e. two objects with

different types can have the same id
property_id : identify the property in the object
property_data : the data in the right data type.

The Xcom-232i responds with a frame with the following frame_data:

service_flags service_id object_type object_id property_id property_data
1 byte 1 byte 2 bytes 4 bytes 2 bytes 0 or 2 bytes
0x02 or 0x03 0x02

service_flags : flags_response = 1, error= Oor1

service_id : 0x01 for READ_PROPERTY
object_type : same as the request
object_id : same as the request
property_id : same as the request

property_data : If error in service_flags is 0, 0 byte of data. If not, 2 bytes of type
ERROR identifying the error code.

4.2.3 Format

The property data are encoded in different formats described below. Some properties have
a format that can be different from one object to an other for the same object_type. For
example an the value_qsp of parameter can be an ENUM or a FLOAT depending on the
parameter id (identified by the object_id). In this case it is described here as type
DYNAMIC. The DTE must then know the exact type of the property for each object to

decode it.
BOOL : binary data, 1 byte, 0 = false, 1 = true, other values are invalid
FORMAT : a property what define the format of an other property, 16 bit

integer
