3.4 Checksum algorithm

The checksum is computed with the following algorithm:

A = OXFF

B=0

For I FROM 0 TO number_of_bytes -1 DO
A := (A + DATA[I]) mod 0x100;
B := (B + A) mod 0x100;

END

checksum[0] :=A

checksum[1] :=B

A and B are byte values and the addition is made modulo 256.

After an invalid parity bit, header or data checksum, the data link layer is reseted and waits
for an other frame.
