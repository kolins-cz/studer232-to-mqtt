4.5 Parameter objects
object_type = 0x0002

All parameters accessible from the remote control can also be modified with the protocol.
The behaviour is the same as if a physical person changes the value with the remote control
buttons. Currently, only changes at the level qsp are possible.

Values of type FLOAT are stored internally in various 16 bit fixed point formats. For this

reason, the read back value after a write can be rounded slightly.

the value that can be entered on the remote
control in level qsp or installer.

min_gsp

0x0006

DYNAMIC

Minimum that can be entered on the remote
control in level qsp or installer.

max_gsp

0x0007

DYNAMIC

Maximum that can be entered on the remote
control in level qsp or installer.

level_qsp

ENUM

accessibility level of this parameter modifiable
in level qsp or installer.

unsaved_value_qsp

0x000D

DYNAMIC

the value that can be entered on the remote
control in level gsp or installer, but without
saving the value in internal flash. See section
“Cyclic write of parameters on the Xtender
Inverter” for more detail.

4.5.2 Values of level properties

The property level_qsp of type ENUM can take the following values:

Name value

VIEW_ONLY 0x0000
BASIC 0x0010
EXPERT 0x0020
INSTALLER 0x0030
QsP 0x0040

4.5.3 Available parameters on the Xtender Inverter

The change of parameters when the inverters are in operation should be done carefully.
The modification of parameters can restart the corresponding algorithm inside the inverter.
For example, the change of a delay can restart the timer attached to it.

object_id : a number starting at 1000. See the complete parameter references at the end
of the RCC User manual.
