3.10 XTENDER Watchdog

The parameters {1628} and {1629} make possible to set a watchdog function inside the
inverter. The watchdog is a monitoring software that restarts the Xtender in case the
communication is lost.

This system is active when the parameter {1628} (Xtender watchdog enable) is enabled
and the parameter {1550} (parameters saved in flash memory) is disabled or if you write
parameter with the property unsaved_value_qsp. Each time the CAN receives a parameter
the counter, whose duration is set in seconds by parameter {1629}, will be restarted. If
no parameter is received during this period of time the Xtender will stop and a RESET will
take place. The device restarts in the configuration determined by the parameter settings
before {1550} was set to “no”.

In a multi-unit system, each Xtender will handle this function independently. Each device
must therefore receive a parameter within the time-frame set by {1629}.

By default this level is deactivated and the time period is set to 60s, adjustable from 10s
to 300s.

3.11 VarioTrack Watchdog

The parameters {10342} and {10343} make possible to set a watchdog function inside
the VarioTrack. The watchdog is a monitoring software that restarts the VarioTrack in case
the communication is lost.

3.12 VarioString Watchdog

The parameters {14218} and {14219} make possible to set a watchdog function inside
the VarioString. The watchdog is a monitoring software that restarts the VarioString in
case the communication is lost.

3.13 Device identification

The RCC/Xcom-232i parameter {5119} allows to identify a device with the signaling
system by flashing all of its LEDs. The written value corresponds to the Xtender’s or
VarioTrack’ SCOM addresses. Unicast and multicast addresses are supported. For the
Xtender, the phase addresses (191, 192 and 193) enable the signalling of all Xtenders on
a given phase at the same time. The value 0 disables all signals. Sending a new value
disables the previous value. If there is no more writing, all signals turn off after 45 seconds.
