4.7 Custom datalog field object
object_type = 0x0005

The custom datalog field is a string present in each Xcom-232i on the system. It has a
maximum length of 250 bytes and is stored in volatile memory. The most recent string of
all the Xcom-232i in a system is stored at the end of the datalog file when it is written to
the SD card. This appends every day at 00:00:30 or when the user requests it via
parameter {5059}, for example.

During the save process of the custom datalog field on the SD card, the use of the SCOM
service results in an error “Ox0013 SCOM_ERROR_GATEWAY_BUSY”.

After a reset, this value is an empty string. Only the service WRITE_PROPERTY on
property_id = Ox1 is allowed.
4.7.1 Format of the string

The 3 characters ; , and # are reserved characters. The characters ; and , are used as a
separator within the string.

The string should begin with a string identifier, for example #STU for the company Studer.
The # character is used to identify the name of the string.
