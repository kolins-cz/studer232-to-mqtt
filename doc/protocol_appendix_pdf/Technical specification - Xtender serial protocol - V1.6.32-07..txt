3.3 Frame

The Xcom-232i and the DTE exchange frames consist of a header of 14 bytes followed by
a variable number of data bytes and 2 bytes of checksum.

start_- frame_- src_- dst_- data_- header_- frame_- data_-
byte flags addr addr length checksum data checksum
2 bytes =
1 byte 1byte | 4 bytes | 4 bytes i 2 bytes N bytes 2 bytes
start_byte

The start byte is always OxAA

frame flags:

BIT7-BIT6 :_ reserved.

BITS : is_datalog_supported, 1 if the datalogger is supported.

BIT4 :  is_new_datalogger_file_present, 1 if there is a new datalog file on the
SD card. This bit is reseted by the datalog read command through the
SCOM or by extracting the SD card.

BIT3 :  is_sd_card_full, 1 if the SD card is full. This bit is reseted by extracting
the SD card.

BIT2 :  is_sd_card_present, 1 if the SD card is present

BIT1 : 1 at each start or restart of the Xcom-232i, also after a WD Reset. This
bit can be cleared with the RCC/Xcom-232i signal parameter {5104}.

BITO :  is_message_pending flag, 1 if there are some messages pendings.

src_addr

src_addr is the source address, 32 bit little endian

dst_addr

dest_addr is the destination address, 32 bit little endian

data_length
the length of the frame’s data, in byte
The maximum number of frame_data is 240 (so that 14+240+2 = 256)

header_checksum

the checksum of the header, from frame_flags to data_length (included)

frame data

the data bytes

data_checksum

the checksum of all the data bytes of frame_data
