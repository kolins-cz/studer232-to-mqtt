3.6 Multicast addresses

A WRITE_PROPERTY to this kind of address will have the effect to change the property
value on all devices of the same kind. READ_PROPERTY operations are not supported.

3.7 Response delay

The response delay of the Xcom-232i can be up to 2 seconds. This is a good value for a
timeout in the DTE implementation.

The reponse delay depends on the bus load (number of devices, number of RCC or Xcom-
232i, values displayed on the RCC). The use of the datalogger on the Xcom-232i or on
other RCC can cause a periodic increase of the reponse delay every 60 seconds.

3.8 Hardware Watchdog

The remote control parameter {5103} " Activation of the watchdog hardware (deactivation
restarts the Xcom-232i)" allows activation or deactivation of the hardware watchdog,
initially disabled. In case the Xcom-232i is not working properly a Reset will be initiated
automatically. The bit 1 of the frame_flags (see 3.3) reflects a start or restart of the Xcom-
232i. This bit can be cleared with the RCC/Xcom-232i parameter {5104} “Clears the restart
flag of Xcom-232i”.

This function reset only the Xcom-232i. For the Xtender, see the parameters {1628} and
{1629} in section “XTENDER Watchdog”.

3.9 SCOM Watchdog

The RCC/Xcom-232i parameters {5095} “Enable SCOM watchdog” and {5096} “SCOM
watchdog delay before reset of Xcom-232i” allow configuration of the SCOM watchdog,
initially disabled. There is two kind of security activated by this parameter. First, when a
request is received a timer is started. If the response is not send after {5096} seconds,
for example if an inverter present does not respond, the Xcom-232i is reset. A second
timer is also activated when the first request arrives. It is set to zero every time a request
is received. When it reaches {5096} seconds the Xcom-232i is reset. Before both kind of
reset a message will be sent. Like the hardware watchdog, the bit 1 of the frame_flags
(see 3.3) reflects a start or restart of the Xcom-232i and it can be cleared with the
RCC/Xcom-232i parameter {5104} “Clears the restart flag of Xcom-232i”.
