3. Data link layer

The data link layer, as defined in the OSI model, is used to send and receive frame on the
RS-232.
3.1 RS-232 configuration
The default RS-232 configuration is defined as :
e A fixed baudrate of 38400 bps
e 1 start bit
e 8 bit of data, LSB first
e 1 parity bit
e even parity
e 1 stop bit

If you require a higher speed, it is possible to increase the Xcom-232i baudrate to 115200
bps. To do that, you require the last version of Xcom Configurator (available to download
on the Studer official website under Download center->Software and Updates) in order to
create the new configuration file. After the configuration file generation, insert the SD card
in the powered Xcom-232i to upgrade his baudrate.

As the baudrate is 3 times bigger, the cable length is 3 times shorter. The maximal cable
length is about 1.3 meters.

The Xcom-232i MUST have at least the software version 1.5.88 or 1.6.20 in order to
support the configuration file.
3.2 Byte Endianness

All values are in little endian, i.e. LSB bytes are sent on the Physical layer first.
