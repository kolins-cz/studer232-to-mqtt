4.5.6 Cyclic write of parameters on other devices

On other devices, such as BSP, Xcom-232i, Xcom-CAN, there no parameter to deactivate
the writing to the non volatile flash memory.

On BSP >= 1.6.12, xcom-CAN >= 1.6.12 and Xcom-232i >= 1.6.12, the property
unsaved_value can be used for cyclical write.

4.5.7 Hours encoding

the hours encoding is in minute since 00:00 in INT32. For example 13:41 is 13*60+41 =
821.

4.5.8 Days of the week encoding

The days of the week selection (parameters {1205}, for example) is coded as a bit field in
a INT32. A day selected as it bit set to 1.

bit BIT31-7 BIT6 | BITS | BIT4 | BIT3 | BIT2 | BIT1 | BITO

day of the week | undefined | SU SA FR TH WE | TU MO

4.5.9 Month of the year encoding

The month of the year selection (parameters {1479}, for example) is coded as a bit field
in a INT32. A month selected as it bit set to 1. January is BITO and December BIT11. The
BIT31 to 12 are undefined.

4.5.10 Date and time encoding

The time of the Real Time Clock of the system is coded as a INT32. The value is the number
of second since 1.1.1970 00:00:00. The parameters {5002} (Date) take and return the
value that contains the complete day and hour information.

4.5.11 Signal encoding

The Signal (parameters {1468}, for example) is coded as a INT32. To send a signal, you
must write the value 1 to the parameter value.
