4.5.4 Cyclic write of parameters on the Xtender Inverter

The Xtender inverter store the parameter values in a non volatile flash memory. Because
of the endurance of this memory, the number of write on a single parameter property is
only guaranteed for 1000 write operations.

To allow the cyclic write of parameters without count limit, the flash should not be
accessed. There are two different ways to archive this. The first is to deactivate the write
via parameter {1550} “Parameters saved in flash memory”. On newer software versions,
there is the possibility to modify the value without accessing the flash with the property
unsaved_value_qsp.

Deactivating the save in flash with {1550}

The parameter {1550} “Parameters saved in flash memory” has the value “yes” by default.
A write of “no” to this parameter value stop the write in the non-volatile flash memory.
This operation is written in the flash memory only the first time, so consecutive writes of
the value “no” to {1550} can be repeated without limit.

After parameter {1550} has been set to “no”, all other parameters can be written without
count limit. Because the values of all other parameters are not stored in flash, the read
operation will give the values before {1550} as be changed to “no”. Also, after a reset the
old values will be taken.

To use the inverter with cyclic write operations you must:
- ensure that all inverters have a firmware version >= 1.4.6
- set the parameter {1550} to “no” on all targeted inverter
- avoid to write cyclically on other devices like BSP, RCC, ...

- ensure that no “reset default/factory settings”, “apply configuration file
(masterfile)” or modification with the remote control change {1550} to “yes”

It is a good pratice to cyclically write “no” to {1550}.

Awrite of “yes” to the parameter {1550} reactivate the write in flash. It will be written in
the flash every time and should not be used more that 1000 time.

Use of the unsaved_value_qsp property

This possibility is only available since version XT >= 1.6.12.

The property unsaved_value_qsp, described in section “Parameter objects, Properties”,
allows to modify the value used by the device software in RAM, without changing the value
saved in flash and loaded at start up. The property va/ue_qsp can be used at the same
time, for example to configure the default value after a turn off or a watchdog reset.

4.5.5 Cyclic write of parameters on VarioTrack and VarioString

The Variotrack and Variostring behave the same way as the Xtender Inverter. The
parameter {10058} for the VarioTrack and {14069} for the VarioString allows to
deactivate the write in non volatile memory.

The property unsaved_value_qsp is available since version VT >= 1.6.14 and VS >=
1.6.12.
